## Description of Target For Game
* In this game the player plays as a tornado whose goal is to fill up their "Nado Meter" by consuming various objects such as buildings, cars, trees, etc.
* The player would have to try and avoid storm chasers who are trying to get rid of the tornado.
* As the player absorbs more objects and causes more destruction they become bigger as well.
* Inbetween levels, the player will be able to select powerups for adding special properties to their tornado.
* Levels would start off in a small setting like a park, then as you progress and get bigger the setting also increases proportionate to the tornado size.

* **Ryan:** Wants to focus on creating powerups between rounds, coding the game logic, and adding new mechanics.
